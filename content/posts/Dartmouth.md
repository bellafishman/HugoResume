I have experience as a _research assistant_ with the Ke Group at **Dartmouth College**.
Optimized synthesis of direct ink writing 3D printable hydrogel for more consistent extrudability. Analyzed gel rheology to unveil insights into its self-healing properties and viscosity. Showcased research findings by presenting a poster at colloquium.
