I have experience as a _peer mentor_ for **CS 310: Scalable Architectures** at **Northwestern University**.
Assisted students in debugging JavaScript, SQL, and Python code using various debugger tools. Developed deep understanding of scalable cloud architectures and deployment strategies using AWS and Docker.
